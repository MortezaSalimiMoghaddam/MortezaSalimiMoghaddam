## üå± About Me
I'm a Communication Systems Engineer with expertise in designing and optimizing systems for digital modulation, noise-resilient processing, and hardware-software co-design. My work focuses on translating stochastic models and DSP algorithms into efficient FPGA and SoC implementations.

Key strengths include:
- Simulating complex systems in MATLAB and generating deployable code via HDL Coder, ensuring the optimal word lengths and scaling through precise fixed-point management.
- FPGA circuit design with meticulous CDC handling for multi-clock domains, ensuring signal integrity.
- Developing parts of algorithmic processing as well as GUIs in Qt Creator with C++ ensuring both speed and user-friendly UI/UX.

Currently exploring anti-spoof GNSS receivers for GPS, Galileo, Beidou, Glonass and NavIC signals. I'm also open to all sorts of collaborations on the aforementioned subjects!
